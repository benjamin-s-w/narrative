			<h1>Narrative Website</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this project is to tell the story of a company that I used to work for, which may be useful to them as their company website. Below I will talk about what I learned through this project.</p>

			<h2>Practical Lesson</h2>
			<p>The most important thing that small businesses have is an ability to connect with their customers in a more personal and intimate way that is not possible for large corporations. So, it seemed better for A to Z to have a site that tells their story in a personal way rather than being just another place to shop for products. Besides, blinds are too hard to shop for online, so why not just stop in?</p>

			<h2>Technical Lesson</h2>
			<p>The first technical challenge I faced in creating this site was learning how to make a parallax effect based website with only HTML and CSS. Many of the websites on the internet use JavaScript or other web programming language to achieve this affect. The most difficult technical challenge of this project was to make sure that this site worked on mobile, tablet, and larger sized screens, which required making changes in the styling of the site based on the various screen sizes of devices that might look at the site. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot by completing this narrative assignment.</p>
